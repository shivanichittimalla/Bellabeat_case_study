Business Task:

The Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat believe that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. The stakeholders are interested in insights into how consumers are using their smart devices based on their tracked activity data. The discoveries will then help guide marketing strategy to focus on one of the Bellabeat products. To summarize, the business task would be: What are the trends in fitness data of non-Bellabeat smart device users? How those insights can be applied to marketing strategies for one of the Bellabeat products?

The data analysis will focus on the following tasks:

Identifying users' habit in tracking daily activities and recording sleep.
Determining metrics to identify users activity level; intensity value vs total steps.
Identifying trends in users' activity levels.
Identifying trends of hourly activity across different user types.
Identifying trends of daily activity on days of the week across different user types.

The dataset contains eighteen tables. Some of them are in the long format of their alternate version, and some are the merged version of several tables. For several metrics, like number of steps and active minutes, the dataset provides daily, hourly, and minute-level of data. Large sample size is preferred to get the best approximate of the population it represents. Sample of 33 users and 31 days could be far from enough to identify the overall consumer behaviours throughout the average device's lifetime. The solution is to collect more data from different data sources or proxy the data. However, for the simplicity of this case study, the given dataset is presumably enough to proceed with the analysis.
